5. Replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of the server Perplexica is running on in these two lines:

```
args:
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3001/api
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:3001

6. Save and close the `docker-compose.yaml` file

7. Rebuild and restart the Perplexica container:

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

## macOS

2. Navigate to the directory with the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```
cd /path/to/docker-compose.yaml
```

3. Stop and remove existing containers and images:
