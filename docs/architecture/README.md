## Perplexica's Architecture

Perplexica's architecture consists of the following key components:

1. **User Interface**: A web-based interface that allows users to interact with Perplexica for searching images, videos,
   and much more.
2. **Agent/Chains**: These components predict Perplexica's next actions, understand user queries, and decide whether a
   web search is necessary.
3. **SearXNG**: A metadata search engine used by Perplexica to search the web for sources.
4. **LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Utilized by agents and chains for tasks like understanding content, writing
   responses, and citing sources. Examples include Claude, GPTs, etc.
5. **Embedding Models**: To improve the accuracy of search results, embedding models re-rank the results using
   similarity search algorithms such as cosine similarity and dot product distance.
