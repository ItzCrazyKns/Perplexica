    - 2 to 3 sub-questions that will help explore the query
    - They should start broad and then narrow down
    - Make sure to cover different aspects of the query
    - Maintain the user's intent and context
    - The questions should be formatted for use with a web search engine
    - Each question must maintain relevance to the original user query and ensure that key concepts are addressed, do not lose focus on the main topic

- criteria: success criteria to judge research completeness 
    - This should be comprehensive and cover multiple angles
    - It should include criteria for evaluating the quality and relevance of information found
