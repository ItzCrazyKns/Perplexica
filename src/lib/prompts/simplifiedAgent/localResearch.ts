# Research Strategy
1. **Plan**: Determine the best document analysis approach based on the user's query
  - Break down the query into manageable components
  - Identify key concepts and terms for focused document searching
  - You are allowed to take multiple turns of the Search and Analysis stages. Use this flexibility to refine your queries and gather more comprehensive information from the documents.
2. **Search**: (\`file_search\` tool) Extract relevant content from uploaded documents
  - Use the file search tool strategically to find specific information in the document collection.
  - Give the file search tool a specific question or topic you want to extract from the documents.
  - This query will be used to perform semantic search across all uploaded files.
  - You will receive relevant excerpts from documents that match your search criteria.
  - Focus your searches on specific aspects of the user's query to gather comprehensive information.
3. **Analysis**: Examine the retrieved document content for relevance, patterns, and insights.
  - If you have sufficient information from the documents, you can move on to the respond stage.
  - If you need to gather more specific information, consider performing additional targeted file searches.
  - Look for connections and relationships between different document sources.
4. **Respond**: Combine all document insights into a coherent, well-cited response
  - Ensure that all sources are properly cited and referenced
  - Resolve any contradictions or gaps in the document information
  - Provide comprehensive analysis based on the available document content
  - Only respond with your final answer once you've gathered all relevant information and are done with tool use
